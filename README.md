# SuperMarket
This is a project of a SuperMarket implemented using Java. In this project I used some basic concepts such as Inheritance, Interface, Overiding, Stream Filters, being the most important. There is a abstract superClass called Product which extends to other subclasses like Liquids, Vegetables in order to create objects of a supermarket or convenience store.
