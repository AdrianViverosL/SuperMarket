# SuperMarket
This is a project of a SuperMarket implemented using Java. In this project I used some basic concepts such as Inheritance, Interface, Overiding, Stream Filters, being the most important. There is a superClass called Product which has other subclasses like Liquids, Vegetables in order to add items or create objects .
